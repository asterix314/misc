= China's "Outdated" Fighter Humiliate the West


Hey everyone, welcome to my channel. Now gather 'round for a story of overconfidence, wasted billions, and an underdog that just wouldn't lose — because today, we're talking about the J-10 fighter jet.

Now, in China, the J-10 is practically ancient history — so old that most people barely remember it exists. Even the J-20 stealth fighter, once the crown jewel of China's air force, has become old news. Yeah, that's the speed at which the Chinese military industry is making leaps and bounds. So naturally, the J-10 is yesterday's technology that we've moved way beyond.

But outside China, it's a whole different story.

Let's set the stage. In December 2021, Pakistan made a smart move — buying 36 J-10CE fighters from China for \$1.5 billion. That's \$42 million per jet. Add in radar, weapons, and support, and you're looking at \$55 million per plane — still an absolute steal.

Now, compare that to India. In 2016, they signed a deal for 36 French Rafale jets — for \$8.8 billion. The bare-bones price was \$167 million per jet. But with weapons and maintenance added it was a ridiculous \$244 million each.

That's five J-10s for the price of one Rafale. To add insult to injury, Pakistan got all its jets in two years. India? Took six.

So why does this matter? Because in May of this year, that's this month, India decided to test its shiny new Rafales in real combat. They launched a surprise attack on Pakistani-controlled Kashmir, sending in their most advanced jets — the French Rafales, Russian Su-30MKIs, and MiG-29s. 

Pakistan, caught off guard, scrambled what it had, 7 J-10CEs, and a few older models as decoys.

- 5:25 AM: Pakistan shoots down two Indian jets — types unknown.
- 7:23 AM: Five more kills:
  - Two Rafales -- boom.
  - One Su-30 -- gone.
  - One MiG-29 -- smoking wreckage.
  - A bonus: one Israeli-made Heron drone.
- 8:27 AM: Another Rafale bites the dust.

Final score?

India: Six jets lost. Pakistan: Zero.

It was the most lopsided air victory in decades. India tried to deny it. But wreckage was everywhere, and civilians filmed it — there was no hiding this disaster.


So, to everyone who said:

"The Rafale is better than the J-20!"

"One Rafale can take five Chinese jets!"

Here's your reality check: The Rafale — France's best, India's pride — got outclassed by China's supposedly outdated second-string fighter.

"But Chinese jets have no combat experience!"

"The West has superior technology!"

Tell that to the flaming wreckage of three Rafales.

And the best part? When the dust settled, investors went wild. Shares of Chengdu Aerospace — the company that builds the J-10 — skyrocketed, dragging the entire defense sector up with it.

Meanwhile, to France, congratulations — you just torched your fighter jet's reputation. Overpriced. Slow to deliver. And now, proven inferior in actual combat.

As for India? Well, they aren't the India of 1962 anymore. No, they're now the India of 2025 — a cautionary tale in how _not_ to spend \$8.8 billion.

Now if China's "outdated" J-10 could do _this_ to the Rafale ... Imagine what the J-20 would do.
