  A complaint against some of my noisy and #voc[noxious][有毒的，讨厌的] neighbours #com[][头韵 alliteration] -- Some comments upon the state of life in a multi-storeyed building -- The mode of life in the Hutong.
]

A few nights ago, when I had finished my nocturnal routine of reading and writing (which #com[is][was? 后文看作者都是现在时和过去时混用的，不再指出。] little different from my ordinary arrangements through the #voc[livelong][（诗、文）整段的，日复一日的] day), I betook myself to sleep. But the night was not so tranquil as it aught to have been, for there was #voc[din obstreperous][吵闹的嘈杂声。形容词后置] on the floor above. Formerly #com[Annie][可能是作者妻子] and I had the vexatious misfortune of having that floor occupied by a family whose young one is a #voc[bungling][笨手笨脚地做，把事情搞糟] student of music. Since the piano is her instrument, an awkward and unimproving exhibition of her musical skills on it was frequently and capriciously propagated into our unwilling ears, whether it be early morning or late night. Such exquisite torture, for exquisite torture it is for someone like me, whose #voc[lucubration][刻苦钻研] #com[am][奇怪。lucubration 应该是 is/was 啊？] easily interrupted by noise #com[far from clamorous][很小的噪音都会影响到“我”的钻研？], #com[was][接的是 exquisite torture] only abated after I had called for the intervention of the police. Apparently this musical family, for not only is the child adept at the performance of wretched and discordant music, but at least one parent, and that the father of the family, has much fervour for it as well, as I have heard at least once, to my inexpressible annoyance and agony, his accompanying the piano of his daughter with singing, #com[has][接上文 this musical family。中间有一大段插入语。] moved out of the house above ours for some time, as in the past several months the #voc[wonted][（诗、文）惯常的，习惯于做某事的] #com[note][notes 是不是更好？] of piano has been heard no more; but the new inhabitants are at least as #voc[vociferous][大声叫的，喧嚷的] as their predecessors, though less adept at employing a proxy for the lungs in their impressive vocal exercises. In a word, the woman at present residing there is so unstable in her mood that she is prone to #com[burst][be prone to sth，此处不该用动词。许是 bursts 之误] into extreme passion, and as her #com[paltry insignificance][过于狠毒了] has confined her dominion strictly within the domestic sphere, her boy is often oppressed with the most smothering tyranny. It is not at all rare to hear her bellow at him in a #voc[paroxysm][疾病周期性发作] of unconstrained fury and malignity, and his loud crying in answer to the #voc[termagant][泼妇，悍妇般的] madness of his mother. An instance of this in an early morning, which commenced well before six o'clock, and protracted for more than an hour, had conduced me to report it to the police by a fear for the sanity and soundness of the child thus ferociously abused. This night there was some novelty in this #voc[strangulating][勒死，使窒息] conversation betwixt mother and son, for the latter let out his overflowing and overwhelming rage in his turn, and yelled with heartbroken desperation, that he would kill himself, and that his mother was compelling him to do so. But still there were no signs of yielding on the part of the mother. Many parents are not qualified for this most vital and most sacred duty of having and raising children. I could not manage to fall into sleep until the clamour had subsided and stopped.

In the Rambler there is a hackney poet who, though confined by his penury to some cheap lodging in the metropolis, nevertheless amuses himself by making inquiries of his landlady concerning the various histories of her tenants, and his readers by recording them as some interesting specimens of ordinary life. Being totally unacquainted with the proprietor of the house above mine, I am unfortunately precluded from putting similar questions to him, and therefore all the intelligence that I could glean about his whilom and incumbent tenants, is from some attentive but paltry occasions of auricular observation. Such is the nigh insurmountable impediment which life in a multi-storeyed residential fabric forcibly throws upon a keen and fervid inspector of the quotidian life, that he must needs resort to extreme impudence in order to gratify his indiscreet and obtrusive curiosity concerning his neighbours’ affairs. Having little, or perhaps none at all, of that amiable quality, the sole piece of information I have managed to collect about my immediate neighbour, after my continual residence in my house for eight months, is his name, which I was only enabled to know by a hasty delivery-man mistaking my house for his. I have only met him two or three times in the public area out of our houses or downstairs, and the only time we greeted each other he was so good as to call me by the number of my apartment. As for Annie, she was ludicrously mistaken for a man by a former neighbour of hers, who once in officious warmth of friendship attempted to introduce her to another woman with the thought of making a match between them. The reason for this facetious fallacy is their never having met in real life even for once. This solitude in multitude, this life of a recluse amidst all the urban bustle and tumult, is both one of the most admirable and one of the most deplorable attributes of life in a large and populated building.

This reluctant obscurity is not only often a sufferance and an imposition, from which common decency and decorum dictates that we shall have neither escape nor exemption; it is also sometimes a cloak and disguise voluntarily assumed for the purpose of safety. While she was living alone in her own apartment formerly, Annie deliberately used a man’s name when she made online purchases (which is an expedient I would recommend all females living singly to adopt), and denied to a young man living next to her house that she is his neighbour, as she considered a frank admission of the fact imprudent and latently hazardous, well knowing that house to be inhabited by several men.

As I had lived in the old and crowded hutong for two and thirty years before moving recently into my more spacious as well as more desolate residence, and as I am completely inured to the openness and familiarity of the life in the alley, I cannot forbear to contrast these two modes of existence, and hold a fond and prejudicial favour for that I am much accustomed to. Life in the alley, or, to be more exact, life in a populous yard, is a sort of country life in the city; for though the locations of the dwellings are undoubtedly urban, the nature of the social relations inherent in such yards is mainly rural. William Hazlitt figuratively but acutely observes, that in a large city a man’s knowledge of other people is like a bust, and it cannot go to the whole-length; many interesting traits and circumstances of even your most intimate city companion are concealed from you. You are not acquainted with the characters and professions of his parents and grandparents, and you are ignorant of the meekness or mischief of his boyish days, which contains the germs and symptoms of his merits and deficiencies when his dimensions are enlarged, and his intellect ripened. You may converse indifferently well with a friend or a colleague for ten or twenty years, without adverting to the mellow charity or inveterate malice within his soul. Yet in a village the pedigree of each family, and the history of each individual is so known to a tittle by those idle and inquisitive old men and women, that their penetration into the mysteries of human nature must make all the abstruse and metaphysical philosophers, as well as solemn and supercilious novel writers, who pride themselves upon their being adepts and professors in that elusive and variegated science, look like mere fools. The opportunities of conducting an incessant, thorough and meticulous examination upon the characters of your neighbours, and thus of improving in the important study of practical philosophy, which are so scanty, and so nearly impossible to obtain, in large cities in general, are plentiful and easy of access to those living in the hutong. Human nature is a speculative subject in large buildings and sequestered apartments, but in the hutong it meliorates (or rather deteriorates, for a acolyte or votary of dreamy philosophers) into a substance, and is to be observed and dissected by any who has sufficient curiosity, carefulness and patience for the task.
